## Overview

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I've been learning the basics of HTML and CSS through YouTube, but I have never really put 
my knowledge into practice until I decided to join this challenge. This is my first
coding challenge and I've learnes a lot.

I've learned how to use flex box layout model for centering. Flex box offers more control
over alignment, spacing and distribution of elements.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
body{
      background-color: #D5E1EF;
      height: 100vh;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      font-family: 'Outfit';

    }
```
```css
.img-container{
      background-color: blue;
      position: relative;
      width: 288px;
      height: 288px;
      overflow: hidden;
      border-radius: 10px;
      margin: 16px;
    }
```

### Continued development

CSS layouts is the area that I wanna improve on.
